For this Ruby Quiz, let's identify and rank poker hands.  Say we have the 
following sample game of the popular Texas Hold 'Em, where you try to make the
best five-card hand from a total of seven cards (five shared among all players):

Kc 9s Ks Kd 9d 3c 6d
9c Ah Ks Kd 9d 3c 6d
Ac Qc Ks Kd 9d 3c
9h 5s
4d 2d Ks Kd 9d 3c 6d
7s Ts Ks Kd 9d

Each line represents a player's final hand.  The cards of the hand are separated
by a space.  The first character is the face value of the card and the second is
the suit.
